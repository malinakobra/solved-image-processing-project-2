Consider the centered DFT for Bird 2.tif, re-synthesize the images using the DFT coefficients (1) inside (r &lt; 30), and (2) outside (r  30) the circular region with radius=30 pixels (based on the original image size), plot the resulted images. Your report (Word or pdf format) should contain:

<ul>

 <li>Source codes (30%)</li>

 <li>Plot of DFT magnitude in Log scale (20%)</li>

 <li>Image constructed by DFT coefficients inside the circular region with radius = 30 pixels (15%)</li>

 <li>Image constructed by DFT coefficients outside the circular region with radius = 30 pixels (15%)</li>

 <li>Table of top 25 DFT frequencies (<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>) in the left half frequency region (0<em>u</em><em>M</em>1, 0<em>v</em><em>N</em>/21) (20%)</li>

</ul>
